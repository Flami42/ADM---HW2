The goal of this assignment is to perform an analysis on the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, collected by [Wyscout] (https://wyscout.com/) containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.)

The repository consists of the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all research questions.

			1. [RQ1] Who wants to be a Champion? During a season could happen that a team has bad periods. For example, more than three consecutive games lost, or it could have a positive trend where it seems to be unbeatable. Let's visualize this trends!
			
			2. [RQ2]: What are the time slots with more passengers?  

			3. [RQ3]: Do all trips last the same?

			4. [RQ4]: What is the most common way of payments?  

			5. [RQ5]: Does a long distance correlate with the duration of the trip on average?  

		Core Research Questions 
			1. [CRQ1]: Does the fare for kilometer change across NY's borough?  
			
			2. [CRQ2]: Visualize Taxis movements!
